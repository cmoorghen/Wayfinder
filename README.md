# Wayfinder
Web program made to assist students by optimizing the process of searching and retrieving the different modules that they are eligible for based on the courses they have taken.Students can input their courses and Wayfinder will tell them all of the modules that they have met the admission requirements for and suggest future ones that they are on track for, rather than them having to search for the module individually and cross reference the courses they have taken with that one the site page.

Our webpage is a a sample of Wayfinder. We implemented a version of it that would work for some real test cases listed below.
